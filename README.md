# scalping-MQL5-script
An MQL5 script which let's you open positions from using your buttons. Great for scalping


## How it works

This is a script I've created for trading US100. After you add it to your MetaTrader5 chart, you can do 3 things:

1. Press C to create a long position
2. Press Z to create a short position
3. Press X to close all open positions (whether short or long)

The positions are all market orders, currently set to 140.00 lots. Adjust as needed.
